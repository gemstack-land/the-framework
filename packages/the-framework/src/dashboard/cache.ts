/**
 * A read-through cache for the dashboard's slow reads (#1028).
 *
 * The dashboard polls. Every session view asks for its branch's PR, twice (the worktree bar and
 * the handoff summary), on every navigation and again every ten seconds — and `gh pr view` costs
 * about 600ms against a local git read's ten. So the same answer was being bought over and over,
 * and the panel waited for it each time.
 *
 * Three behaviours, and each one is load-bearing:
 *   - **single flight** — concurrent asks for the same key share one call, so two panels and a
 *     poll tick do not become three subprocesses
 *   - **stale while revalidate** — once a value exists it is returned immediately, and refreshed
 *     in the background when it is older than `ttlMs`; nobody waits twice for the same answer
 *   - **a budget on the cold ask** — the first ask waits only `budgetMs` for the answer before
 *     reporting `pending`, so a slow lookup delays one panel's extra detail rather than the page
 *
 * `pending` is not "failed": it means the answer is on its way and the next read will have it.
 * A caller that must not act on a half-answer (offering to open a PR that may already exist)
 * uses it to hold off.
