// exporting it as-was would have pulled `node:fs` into the browser bundle. That
// is why the disk half now lives in `system-prompt-file.ts`.

// Walk the real import graph rather than trusting the rule to be remembered. It
// walks the *compiled* output, not the source: `import type` erases at compile,
// so source would report type-only edges (run-view -> driver) as false leaks.
// What ships is what matters.
