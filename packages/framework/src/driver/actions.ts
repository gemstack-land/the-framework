/**
 * A {@link Driver} that runs the agent on **GitHub Actions** instead of on this
 * machine (#610): dispatch a workflow, poll it, read the transcript it uploads.
 *
 * This is the answer to "drive Claude Code on the web". The routines fire API was
 * the obvious candidate and turned out unusable — the prompt arrives wrapped as
 * untrusted data, and there is no read-back of any kind. The official
 * `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` has neither problem: the prompt is passed
 * verbatim, and the run publishes its full transcript. Auth is the same
 * subscription posture as everywhere else (#495): a `claude setup-token` OAuth
 * token held by the repo, never an API key of ours.
 *
 * It fits `Driver`/`DriverSession` as written, with no new methods. What changes is
 * not the shape but the tempo, and those costs are real:
 *
 * - **Minutes, not seconds.** Every `prompt` is a fresh runner and a fresh
 *   checkout. Continuity comes from the branch the previous turn pushed, which the
 *   session tracks and dispatches onto next time.
 * - **No live stream.** The transcript arrives once, at the end, so the dashboard's
 *   {@link DriverStartOptions.onEvent} feed replays in a burst rather than trickling.
 * - **Quota is the account's, not the runner's.** Free minutes on a public repo
 *   change nothing about the subscription window every run draws down.
 *
 * The workspace lives on a runner that is gone by the time we read it, so
 * {@link ActionsSession.readCode} reads from the pushed branch over the contents
 * API rather than from disk.
