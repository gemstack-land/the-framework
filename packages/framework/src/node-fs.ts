/**
 * The one `node:fs/promises` adapter. Every `node*Fs()` factory in the package
 * returns this under its own narrow type: the store may append, the registry may
 * not, and those interfaces stay separate because they are the consumers'
 * contracts. Only the implementation was worth sharing, and it was written out
 * four times before this.
 *
 * Every import is dynamic, which is the whole point of the convention: a module
 * that reads files keeps a `node:fs` edge out of its static import graph, so it
 * can be reached from browser-safe code as long as the read itself never runs
 * there. `client.test.ts` enforces the graph half.
